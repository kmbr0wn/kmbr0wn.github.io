    <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
    <h4>I am an inquisitive person who always wants to know the why and the how. I graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C. with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I am currently working at the Metro Nashville Public School Central Office as the ESEA (Every Student Succeeds Act) Compliance Analyst. I enjoy analyzing data to see how we can be more efficient.</h4>
    <br />
    <h4>Due to my curiosity and desire for efficiency, I have enrolled in a Data Analytics Course at Vanderbilt University, broadening my knowledge and skills to add more value to my work and the school District as a whole.</h4>
